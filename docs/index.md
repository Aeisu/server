## Welcome to team LandSandBoat's github page!

Our main repository most people will be interested in is the `server` repository, linked on this page.

## Communication with the team
For discussions we use [Github Discussions](https://github.com/LandSandBoat/server/discussions) rather than a discord server as our predecessors in Topaz and Darkstar did.

## Workflow
 * [base](https://github.com/LandSandBoat/server/tree/base): All new work should begin life as a copy of this branch, regardless of its destination at completion time. Be sure to _base_ your pull requests off of this `base` branch!  

 * [everything](https://github.com/LandSandBoat/server/tree/everything) : Everything really means _everything!_  All things, if they have been reviewed, can and will arrive at this branch - including things in the `base` branch. If we don't think something is ready for the `base` branch, it can still get into the `everything` branch!

 * [Others](https://github.com/LandSandBoat/server/branches/all): there may be additional branches not specified here. <br>***You should not ever pull them to your server, you WILL eventually get a broken server from it. <br>We will NOT help you with that. You have been warned!***

## Wiki
 * Yes, we have a [wiki](https://github.com/LandSandBoat/server/wiki)
